## How to Play

* The board is a 3 × 3 grid.
* Player X starts first.
* Players alternate placing their mark (X or O) in any empty cell.
* The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins!
* If all 9 cells are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a draw.
* Click the **Reset/New Game** button to clear the board and play again.
